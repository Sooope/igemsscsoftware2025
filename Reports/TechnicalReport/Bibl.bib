abstract = {Assessing the severity of eczema in clinical research requires face-to-face skin examination by trained staff. Such approaches are resource-intensive for participants and staff, challenging during pandemics, and prone to inter- and intra-observer variation. Computer vision algorithms have been proposed to automate the assessment of eczema severity using digital camera images. However, they often require human intervention to detect eczema lesions and cannot automatically assess eczema severity from real-world images in an end-to-end pipeline. We developed a model to detect eczema lesions from images using data augmentation and pixel-level segmentation of eczema lesions on 1,345 images provided by dermatologists. We evaluated the quality of the obtained segmentation compared with that of the clinicians, the robustness to varying imaging conditions encountered in real-life images, such as lighting, focus, and blur, and the performance of downstream severity prediction when using the detected eczema lesions. The quality and robustness of eczema lesion detection increased by approximately 25% and 40%, respectively, compared with that of our previous eczema detection model. The performance of the downstream severity prediction remained unchanged. Use of skin segmentation as an alternative to eczema segmentation that requires specialist labeling showed the performance on par with when eczema segmentation is used.}

abstract="Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is one of the most common chronic skin diseases. AD severity is primarily evaluated based on visual inspections by clinicians, but is subjective and has large inter- and intra-observer variability in many clinical study settings. To aid the standardisation and automating the evaluation of AD severity, this paper introduces a CNN computer vision pipeline, EczemaNet, that first detects areas of AD from photographs and then makes probabilistic predictions on the severity of the disease. EczemaNet combines transfer and multitask learning, ordinal classification, and ensembling over crops to make its final predictions. We test EczemaNet using a set of images acquired in a published clinical trial, and demonstrate low RMSE with well-calibrated prediction intervals. We show the effectiveness of using CNNs for non-neoplastic dermatological diseases with a medium-size dataset, and their potential for more efficiently and objectively evaluating AD severity, which has greater clinical relevance than mere classification.",
