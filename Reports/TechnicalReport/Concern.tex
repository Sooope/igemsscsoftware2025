\section{Concerns}
There are some concerns toward our platform, in this section we analyzed some concerns and risk we may have in the development of the platform.

Firstly, the copyright of data, since our data collection mainly come from internet, there is risk of using unauthorized data in our dataset. This can be considered as a major risk in our platform.

Furthermore, as we have mentioned above, the accuracy of artificial intelligence in medical aspect is a concern. Especially the language model, information provided by language model could be inaccurate, and wrong information in medical field can cause serious impact. Therefore, using NLP models is risky, we must inform the risk to users that all information generated by NLP is unreliable and can only for their reference, and also avoid using NLP to provide important information to users.

In conclusion, the main concerns in our platform are come from copyright and accuracy issue, we must handle the risks with care.
